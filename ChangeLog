	* ChangeLog, dialogs/keyboard-settings/shortcut-dialog.c,
	  xfce4-settings-helper/keyboard-shortcuts.c:
	  * dialogs/keyboard-settings/shortcuts-dialog.c,
	  xfce4-settings-helper/keyboard-shortcuts.c: Add two new functions
	  called get_modifier_masks() and get_ignore_mask(). The first
	  determines to which of the Mod2-Mod5 modifiers CapsLock, NumLock
	  and ScrollLock are mapped and generates a modifier mask for them.
	  The latter combines this mask with the IGNORED_MODIFIERS mask
	  which we already used before and which includes GDK_HYPER_MASK
	  etc.. This mask is then used in several places to avoid these
	  modifiers to appear in the result of gtk_accelerator_name() and
	  to properly grab the shortcuts. This should fix bug #4304.
	* ChangeLog, dialogs/keyboard-settings/shortcut-dialog.c:
	  * dialogs/keyboard-settings/shortcut-dialog.c: Ignore
	  GDK_SUPER_MASK, GDK_HYPER_MASK and GDK_META_MASK when parsing key
	  release events. xfce4-settings-helper handles X events instead of
	  Gdk events and unlike Gdk X doesn't know which of the Super, Meta
	  and Hyper keys are mapped to Mod2-Mod5. Having <Super>, <Meta>,
	  <Hyper> or even <Super>Super_L in the accelerator name will cause
	  the saved shortcut names to be different than the ones generated
	  by parsing X key events. This should fix bug #4304 although I
	  suppose it would be nicer to determine which keys are mapped to
	  Mod2-Mod5 when parsing X key events from the semantic point of
	  view.

	  xfce4-settings-manager/xfce-settings-manager-dialog.c,

	  * xfce4-settings-manager/xfce-settings-manager-dialog.c Dialog
	  default size is 600x400px; Changed window icon name to
	  preferences-desktop instead of xfce4-settings, since that's the
	  default icon name; Don't show the dialog separator. Scrolled
	  window shadow is GTK_SHADOW_IN. *

	  dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/mouse-settings/mouse-dialog.glade: Change maximum border
	  width of all boxes to 6 in order to align the toplevel boxes with
	  the dialog buttons. Update the mouse dialog in the same way as I
	  did with the others before.
	* ChangeLog, dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade:
	  * dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade: Same procedure
	  as before.
	* ChangeLog,
	  dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade:
	  * dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade: Same
	  here. Maybe I should also mention that all these dialogs now use
	  XfceTitledDialog instead of GtkDialog and XfceHeading.
	* ChangeLog, dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade:
	  * dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade: Improve
	  the dialog layout. I've chosen 12px for horizontal distance and
	  6px for horizontal distance between neighboured widgets. All
	  boxes now have a border of 10px expect for those inside
	  notebooks+alignments: they now have a border of 6px.
